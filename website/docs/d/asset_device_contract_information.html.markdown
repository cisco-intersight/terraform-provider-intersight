Contains information about the Cisco device identified by a unique identifier like serial number. It also contains information about warranty, contract status, validity of the device. In future this object could be expanded to store Case, RMA, device topology details. We observe new asset.DeviceRegisteration and use it as a trigger for creating an instance of this object.
