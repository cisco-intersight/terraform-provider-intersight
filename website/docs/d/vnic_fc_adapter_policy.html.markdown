# Data Source: intersight_vnic_fc_adapter_policy
A Fibre Channel Adapter policy governs the host-side behavior of the adapter, including how the adapter handles traffic. You can enable FCP Error Recovery, change the default settings of Queues and Interrupt handling for performance enhancement.
## Argument Reference
The following arguments can be used to get data of already created objects in Intersight appliance:
* `description`:(string)Description of the policy.
* `error_detection_timeout`:(int)Error Detection Timeout, also referred to as EDTOV, is the number of milliseconds to wait before the system assumes that an error has occurred.
* `io_throttle_count`:(int)The maximum number of data or control I/O operations that can be pending for the virtual interface at one time. If this value is exceeded, the additional I/O operations wait in the queue until the number of pending I/O operations decreases and the additional operations can be processed.
* `lun_count`:(int)The maximum number of LUNs that the Fibre Channel driver will export or show. The maximum number of LUNs is usually controlled by the operating system running on the server.
* `lun_queue_depth`:(int)The number of commands that the HBA can send and receive in a single transmission per LUN.
* `moid`:(string)The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance.
* `name`:(string)Name of the concrete policy.
* `object_type`:(string)The fully-qualified type of this managed object, i.e. the class name.This property is optional. The ObjectType is implied from the URL path.If specified, the value of objectType must match the class name specified in the URL path.
* `resource_allocation_timeout`:(int)Resource Allocation Timeout, also referred to as RATOV, is the number of milliseconds to wait before the system assumes that a resource cannot be properly allocated.
