# Resource: intersight_vnic._eth_network_policy
An Ethernet Network policy determines if the port can carry single VLAN (Access) or multiple VLANs (Trunk) traffic. You can specify the VLAN to be associated with an Ethernet packet if no tag is found.
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `class_id`:(string)(Computed)"The concrete type of this complex type. Its value must be the same as the 'objectType' property.\nThe OpenAPI document references this property as a discriminator value."
* `description`:(string)"Description of the policy."
* `moid`:(string)"The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance."
* `name`:(string)"Name of the concrete policy."
* `object_type`:(string)(Computed)"The fully-qualified type of this managed object, i.e. the class name.\nThis property is optional. The ObjectType is implied from the URL path.\nIf specified, the value of objectType must match the class name specified in the URL path."
* `organization`:(Array with Maximum of one item) -"A reference to a organizationOrganization resource.\nWhen the $expand query parameter is specified, the referenced resource is returned inline."
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `class_id`:(string)(Computed)"The concrete type of this complex type. Its value must be the same as the 'objectType' property.\nThe OpenAPI document references this property as a discriminator value."
  + `link`:(string)"A URL to an instance of the 'mo.MoRef' class."
  + `moid`:(string)(Computed)"The Moid of the referenced REST resource."
  + `object_type`:(string)"The concrete type of this complex type.\nThe ObjectType property must be set explicitly by API clients when the type is ambiguous. In all other cases, the \nObjectType is optional. \nThe type is ambiguous when a managed object contains an array of nested documents, and the documents in the array\nare heterogeneous, i.e. the array can contain nested documents of different types."
  + `selector`:(string)(Computed)"An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field may\nbe set instead of 'moid' by clients.\n1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.\n1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of the\nresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the object\ninstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.\nAn error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.\nAn example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'."
* `permission_resources`:(Array)(Computed)"An array of relationships to moBaseMo resources."

* `tags`:(Array)
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `key`:(string)"The string representation of a tag key."
  + `value`:(string)"The string representation of a tag value."
* `vlan_settings`:(Array with Maximum of one item) -"VLAN configuration for the virtual interface."
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `class_id`:(string)(Computed)"The concrete type of this complex type. Its value must be the same as the 'objectType' property.\nThe OpenAPI document references this property as a discriminator value."
  + `default_vlan`:(int)"Default VLAN ID of the virtual interface. Setting the ID to 0 will not associate any default VLAN to the traffic on the virtual interface."
  + `mode`:(string)"Option to determine if the port can carry single VLAN (Access) or multiple VLANs (Trunk) traffic."
  + `object_type`:(string)"The concrete type of this complex type.\nThe ObjectType property must be set explicitly by API clients when the type is ambiguous. In all other cases, the \nObjectType is optional. \nThe type is ambiguous when a managed object contains an array of nested documents, and the documents in the array\nare heterogeneous, i.e. the array can contain nested documents of different types."
