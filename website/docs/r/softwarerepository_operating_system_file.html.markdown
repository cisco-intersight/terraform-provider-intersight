# Resource: intersight_softwarerepository_operating_system_file
An operating system image that resides either in an external repository or has been imported to the local repository. If the file is available in the local repository, it is marked as cached. If not, it represents a pointer to a file in an external repository.

## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `catalog`:(Array with Maximum of one item) -The catalog where this image is present.
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `moid`:(string)(Computed)The Moid of the referenced REST resource.
  + `object_type`:(string)(Computed)The Object Type of the referenced REST resource.
  + `selector`:(string)(Computed)An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored. If 'selector'is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight will determine the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populate it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request. An error is returned if the filtermatches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'.
* `description`:(string)User provided description about the file. Cisco provided description for image inventoried from a Cisco repository.
* `download_count`:(int)(Computed)The number of times this file has been downloaded from the local repository. It is used by the repository monitoring process to determine the files that are to be evicted from the cache.
* `import_action`:(string)The action to be performed on the imported file. If 'PreCache' is set, the image will be cached in Appliance. Applicable in Intersight appliance deployment. If 'Evict' is set, the cached file will be removed. Applicable in Intersight appliance deployment. If 'GeneratePreSignedUploadUrl' is set, generates pre signed URL (s) for the file to be imported into the repository. Applicable for local machine source. The URL (s) will be populated under LocalMachine file server. If 'CompleteImportProcess' is set, the ImportState is marked as 'Imported'. Applicable for local machine source. If 'Cancel' is set, the ImportState is marked as 'Failed'. Applicable for local machine source.
* `import_state`:(string)(Computed)The state  of this file in the repository or Appliance. The importState is updated during the import operation and as part of the repository monitoring process.
* `md5sum`:(string)The md5sum checksum of the file. This information is available for all Cisco distributed images and files imported to the local repository.
* `moid`:(string)The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance.
* `name`:(string)The name of the file. It is populated as part of the image import operation.
* `object_type`:(string)(Computed)The fully-qualified type of this managed object, i.e. the class name.This property is optional. The ObjectType is implied from the URL path.If specified, the value of objectType must match the class name specified in the URL path.
* `permission_resources`:(Array)(Computed)A slice of all permission resources (organizations) associated with this object. Permission ties resources and its associated roles/privileges.These resources which can be specified in a permission is PermissionResource. Currently only organizations can be specified in permission.All logical and physical resources part of an organization will have organization in PermissionResources field.If DeviceRegistration contains another DeviceRegistration and if parent is in org1 and child is part of org2, then child objects willhave PermissionResources as org1 and org2. Parent Objects will have PermissionResources as org1.All profiles/policies created with in an organization will have the organization as PermissionResources.
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `moid`:(string)(Computed)The Moid of the referenced REST resource.
  + `object_type`:(string)(Computed)The Object Type of the referenced REST resource.
  + `selector`:(string)(Computed)An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored. If 'selector'is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight will determine the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populate it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request. An error is returned if the filtermatches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'.
* `sha512sum`:(string)The sha512sum of the file. This information is available for all Cisco distributed images and files imported to the local repository.
* `size`:(int)The size (in bytes) of the file. This information is available for all Cisco distributed images and files imported to the local repository.
* `software_advisory_url`:(string)The software advisory, if any, provided by the vendor for this file.
* `source`:(Array with Maximum of one item) -Location of the file in an external repository.
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
  + `object_type`:(string)The concrete type of this complex type.The ObjectType property must be set explicitly by API clients when the type is ambiguous. In all other cases, the ObjectType is optional. The type is ambiguous when a managed object contains an array of nested documents, and the documents in the arrayare heterogeneous, i.e. the array can contain nested documents of different types.
* `tags`:(Array)The array of tags, which allow to add key, value meta-data to managed objects.
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
  + `key`:(string)The string representation of a tag key.
  + `object_type`:(string)The concrete type of this complex type.The ObjectType property must be set explicitly by API clients when the type is ambiguous. In all other cases, the ObjectType is optional. The type is ambiguous when a managed object contains an array of nested documents, and the documents in the arrayare heterogeneous, i.e. the array can contain nested documents of different types.
  + `value`:(string)The string representation of a tag value.
* `vendor`:(string)The vendor or publisher of this file.
* `version`:(string)Vendor provided version for the file.
