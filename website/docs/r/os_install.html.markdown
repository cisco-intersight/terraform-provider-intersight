# Resource: intersight_os_install
This MO models the target server, answers and other properties needed for
OS installation. The OS installation can be started in the target server by doing
a POST on this MO.
The requests to this MO starts a OS installation workflow that can be tracked
using workflow engine MO workflow.WorkflowInfo.
## Argument Reference
