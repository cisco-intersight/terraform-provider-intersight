# Resource: intersight_iam_trust_point
To affirm the identity of trusted source.
Allows import of third-party CA certificates in X.509 (CER) format.
It can be a root CA or an trust chain that leads to a root CA.
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `account`:(Array with Maximum of one item) -(Computed)"The account associated with the Trustpoint."
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `moid`:(string)(Computed)"The Moid of the referenced REST resource."
  + `object_type`:(string)(Computed)"The Object Type of the referenced REST resource."
  + `selector`:(string)(Computed)"An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field may\nbe set instead of 'moid' by clients.\n1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.\n1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of the\nresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the object\ninstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.\nAn error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.\nAn example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'."
* `certificates`:(Array)(Computed)"The collection of certificates in X509 certificate format.\nThis was obtained by parsing the chain property which holds the base 64 encoded chain of certificates."
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
  + `class_id`:(string)(Computed)"The concrete type of this complex type. Its value must be the same as the 'objectType' property.\nThe OpenAPI document references this property as a discriminator value."
  + `issuer`:(Array with Maximum of one item) -(Computed)"The X.509 distinguished name of the issuer of this certificate."

    + `class_id`:(string)(Computed)"The concrete type of this complex type. Its value must be the same as the 'objectType' property.\nThe OpenAPI document references this property as a discriminator value."
    + `common_name`:(string)(Computed)"A required component that identifies a person or an object."
    + `country`:
                (Array of schema.TypeString) -(Computed)"Identifier for the country in which the entity resides."
    + `locality`:
                (Array of schema.TypeString) -(Computed)"Identifier for the place where the entry resides. The locality can be a city, county, township, or other geographic region."
    + `object_type`:(string)"The concrete type of this complex type.\nThe ObjectType property must be set explicitly by API clients when the type is ambiguous. In all other cases, the \nObjectType is optional. \nThe type is ambiguous when a managed object contains an array of nested documents, and the documents in the array\nare heterogeneous, i.e. the array can contain nested documents of different types."
    + `organization`:
                (Array of schema.TypeString) -(Computed)"Identifier for the organization in which the entity resides."

    + `state`:
                (Array of schema.TypeString) -(Computed)"Identifier for the state or province of the entity."
  + `object_type`:(string)"The concrete type of this complex type.\nThe ObjectType property must be set explicitly by API clients when the type is ambiguous. In all other cases, the \nObjectType is optional. \nThe type is ambiguous when a managed object contains an array of nested documents, and the documents in the array\nare heterogeneous, i.e. the array can contain nested documents of different types."
  + `pem_certificate`:(string)"The base64 encoded certificate in PEM format."
  + `sha256_fingerprint`:(string)(Computed)"The computed SHA-256 fingerprint of the certificate. Equivalent to 'openssl x509 -fingerprint -sha256'."
