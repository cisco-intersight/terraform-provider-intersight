# Resource: intersight_firmware_upgrade
Firmware upgrade operation that downloads the image from Cisco/appliance/user provided HTTP repository or use the image from a network share and upgrade. The direct download is used for upgrade to use the image from Cisco repository or appliance repository. The network share is used for upgrade to use the image from a network share in user data center.
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `device`:(Array with Maximum of one item) -(Computed)The device onto which the upgrade is peformed.
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `moid`:(string)(Computed)The Moid of the referenced REST resource.
  + `object_type`:(string)(Computed)The Object Type of the referenced REST resource.
  + `selector`:(string)(Computed)An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored. If 'selector'is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight will determine the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populate it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request. An error is returned if the filtermatches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'.
* `direct_download`:(Array with Maximum of one item) -Direct download options in case the upgradeType is direct download based upgrade.
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `additional_properties`:
