description: |-
  Used to define a task which can be included within a workflow. Task definition conveys the intent that we want to achieve with the task. We can have a standalone task definition that is bound to a single implementation for that task, or we can define an TaskDefinition that will serve as the interface task definition which is linked to multiple implementation tasks. Each implemented TaskDefinition will be bound to its own implementation so we can achieve a case where single TaskDefinition has multiple implementations.

# Resource: intersight_workflow._task_definition
Used to define a task which can be included within a workflow. Task definition conveys the intent that we want to achieve with the task. We can have a standalone task definition that is bound to a single implementation for that task, or we can define an TaskDefinition that will serve as the interface task definition which is linked to multiple implementation tasks. Each implemented TaskDefinition will be bound to its own implementation so we can achieve a case where single TaskDefinition has multiple implementations.
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `catalog`:(Array with Maximum of one item) -"A reference to a workflowCatalog resource.\nWhen the $expand query parameter is specified, the referenced resource is returned inline."
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `class_id`:(string)(Computed)"The concrete type of this complex type. Its value must be the same as the 'objectType' property.\nThe OpenAPI document references this property as a discriminator value."
  + `link`:(string)"A URL to an instance of the 'mo.MoRef' class."
  + `moid`:(string)(Computed)"The Moid of the referenced REST resource."
  + `object_type`:(string)"The concrete type of this complex type.\nThe ObjectType property must be set explicitly by API clients when the type is ambiguous. In all other cases, the \nObjectType is optional. \nThe type is ambiguous when a managed object contains an array of nested documents, and the documents in the array\nare heterogeneous, i.e. the array can contain nested documents of different types."
  + `selector`:(string)(Computed)"An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field may\nbe set instead of 'moid' by clients.\n1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.\n1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of the\nresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the object\ninstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.\nAn error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.\nAn example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'."
* `class_id`:(string)(Computed)"The concrete type of this complex type. Its value must be the same as the 'objectType' property.\nThe OpenAPI document references this property as a discriminator value."
* `default_version`:(bool)"When true this will be the task version that is used when a specific task definition version is not specified. The very first task definition created with a name will be set as the default version, after that user can explicitly set any version of the task definition as the default version."
* `description`:(string)"The task definition description to describe what this task will do when executed."
* `implemented_tasks`:(Array)"An array of relationships to workflowTaskDefinition resources."
