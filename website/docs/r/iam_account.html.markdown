# Resource: intersight_iam_account
The Intersight Account used to access Intersight.
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `app_registrations`:(Array)(Computed)"List of registered OAuth2 applications created from the account."
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `moid`:(string)(Computed)"The Moid of the referenced REST resource."
  + `object_type`:(string)(Computed)"The Object Type of the referenced REST resource."
  + `selector`:(string)(Computed)"An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field may\nbe set instead of 'moid' by clients. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored. If 'selector'\nis set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight will determine the Moid of the\nresource matching the filter expression and populate it in the MoRef that is part of the object\ninstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request. An error is returned if the filter\nmatches zero or more than one REST resource.\nAn example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'."
