# Resource: intersight_iam_account
The Intersight Account used to access Intersight.
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `app_registrations`:(Array)(Computed)List of registered OAuth2 applications created from the account.
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `moid`:(string)(Computed)The Moid of the referenced REST resource.
  + `object_type`:(string)(Computed)The Object Type of the referenced REST resource.
  + `selector`:(string)(Computed)An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored. If 'selector'is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight will determine the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populate it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request. An error is returned if the filtermatches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'.
* `domain_groups`:(Array)(Computed)The domain Groups are configured in an account for scaling purpose. Currently, only onboarding-device account has multiple domain groups and other accounts have only one domain group per account.
