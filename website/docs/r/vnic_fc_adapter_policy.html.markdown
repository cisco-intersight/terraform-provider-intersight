# Resource: intersight_vnic_fc_adapter_policy
A Fibre Channel Adapter policy governs the host-side behavior of the adapter, including how the adapter handles traffic. You can enable FCP Error Recovery, change the default settings of Queues and Interrupt handling for performance enhancement.
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `description`:(string)Description of the policy.
* `error_detection_timeout`:(int)Error Detection Timeout, also referred to as EDTOV, is the number of milliseconds to wait before the system assumes that an error has occurred.
* `error_recovery_settings`:(Array with Maximum of one item) -Fibre Channel Error Recovery Settings.
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
  + `enabled`:(bool)Enables Fibre Channel Error recovery.
  + `io_retry_count`:(int)The number of times an I/O request to a port is retried because the port is busy before the system decides the port is unavailable.
  + `io_retry_timeout`:(int)The number of seconds the adapter waits before aborting the pending command and resending the same IO request.
  + `link_down_timeout`:(int)The number of milliseconds the port should actually be down before it is marked down and fabric connectivity is lost.
  + `object_type`:(string)The concrete type of this complex type.The ObjectType property must be set explicitly by API clients when the type is ambiguous. In all other cases, the ObjectType is optional. The type is ambiguous when a managed object contains an array of nested documents, and the documents in the arrayare heterogeneous, i.e. the array can contain nested documents of different types.
  + `port_down_timeout`:(int)The number of milliseconds a remote Fibre Channel port should be offline before informing the SCSI upper layer that the port is unavailable. For a server with a VIC adapter running ESXi, the recommended value is 10000. For a server with a port used to boot a Windows OS from the SAN, the recommended value is 5000 milliseconds.
* `flogi_settings`:(Array with Maximum of one item) -Fibre Channel Flogi Settings.
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
  + `object_type`:(string)The concrete type of this complex type.The ObjectType property must be set explicitly by API clients when the type is ambiguous. In all other cases, the ObjectType is optional. The type is ambiguous when a managed object contains an array of nested documents, and the documents in the arrayare heterogeneous, i.e. the array can contain nested documents of different types.
  + `retries`:(int)The number of times that the system tries to log in to the fabric after the first failure.
  + `timeout`:(int)The number of milliseconds that the system waits before it tries to log in again.
* `interrupt_settings`:(Array with Maximum of one item) -Interrupt Settings for the virtual fibre channel interface.
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
  + `mode`:(string)The preferred driver interrupt mode. This can be one of the following:- MSIx - Message Signaled Interrupts (MSI) with the optional extension. MSI  - MSI only. INTx - PCI INTx interrupts. MSIx is the recommended option.
  + `object_type`:(string)The concrete type of this complex type.The ObjectType property must be set explicitly by API clients when the type is ambiguous. In all other cases, the ObjectType is optional. The type is ambiguous when a managed object contains an array of nested documents, and the documents in the arrayare heterogeneous, i.e. the array can contain nested documents of different types.
* `io_throttle_count`:(int)The maximum number of data or control I/O operations that can be pending for the virtual interface at one time. If this value is exceeded, the additional I/O operations wait in the queue until the number of pending I/O operations decreases and the additional operations can be processed.
* `lun_count`:(int)The maximum number of LUNs that the Fibre Channel driver will export or show. The maximum number of LUNs is usually controlled by the operating system running on the server.
* `lun_queue_depth`:(int)The number of commands that the HBA can send and receive in a single transmission per LUN.
* `moid`:(string)The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance.
* `name`:(string)Name of the concrete policy.
* `object_type`:(string)(Computed)The fully-qualified type of this managed object, i.e. the class name.This property is optional. The ObjectType is implied from the URL path.If specified, the value of objectType must match the class name specified in the URL path.
* `organization`:(Array with Maximum of one item) -Relationship to the Organization that owns the Managed Object.
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `moid`:(string)(Computed)The Moid of the referenced REST resource.
  + `object_type`:(string)(Computed)The Object Type of the referenced REST resource.
  + `selector`:(string)(Computed)An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored. If 'selector'is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight will determine the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populate it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request. An error is returned if the filtermatches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'.
* `permission_resources`:(Array)(Computed)A slice of all permission resources (organizations) associated with this object. Permission ties resources and its associated roles/privileges.These resources which can be specified in a permission is PermissionResource. Currently only organizations can be specified in permission.All logical and physical resources part of an organization will have organization in PermissionResources field.If DeviceRegistration contains another DeviceRegistration and if parent is in org1 and child is part of org2, then child objects willhave PermissionResources as org1 and org2. Parent Objects will have PermissionResources as org1.All profiles/policies created with in an organization will have the organization as PermissionResources.
