# Resource: intersight_workflow_workflow_definition
Workflow definition is a collection of tasks that are sequenced in a certain way using control tasks. The tasks in the workflow definition is represented as a directed acyclic graph where each node in the graph is a task and the edges in the graph are transitions from one task to another.
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `catalog`:(Array with Maximum of one item) -The catalog under which the definition is present.
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `moid`:(string)(Computed)The Moid of the referenced REST resource.
  + `object_type`:(string)(Computed)The Object Type of the referenced REST resource.
  + `selector`:(string)(Computed)An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored. If 'selector'is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight will determine the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populate it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request. An error is returned if the filtermatches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'.
* `default_version`:(bool)When true this will be the workflow version that is used when a specific workflow definition version is not specified. The default version is used when user executes a workflow without specifying a version or when workflow is included in another workflow without a specific version. The very first workflow definition created with a name will be set as the default version, after that user can explicitly set any version of the workflow definition as the default version.
* `description`:(string)The description for this workflow.
* `input_definition`:(Array)The schema expected for input parameters for this workflow.
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
  + `default`:(Array with Maximum of one item) -Default value for the data type. If default value was provided and the input was required the default value will be used as the input.

    + `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
    + `object_type`:(string)The concrete type of this complex type.The ObjectType property must be set explicitly by API clients when the type is ambiguous. In all other cases, the ObjectType is optional. The type is ambiguous when a managed object contains an array of nested documents, and the documents in the arrayare heterogeneous, i.e. the array can contain nested documents of different types.
    + `override`:(bool)Override the default value provided for the data type. When true, allow the user to enter value for the data type.
    + `value`:Default value for the data type. If default value was provided and the input was required the default value will be used as the input.
  + `description`:(string)Provide a detailed description of the data type.
  + `label`:(string)Descriptive label for the data type. Name can only contain letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), hyphen (-), space ( ) or an underscore (_). The first and last character in label must be an alphanumeric character.

  + `object_type`:(string)The concrete type of this complex type.The ObjectType property must be set explicitly by API clients when the type is ambiguous. In all other cases, the ObjectType is optional. The type is ambiguous when a managed object contains an array of nested documents, and the documents in the arrayare heterogeneous, i.e. the array can contain nested documents of different types.

You can map any task output to a workflow output as long as the types are compatible. Following this is JSON path expression to extract JSON fragment from source's output.
