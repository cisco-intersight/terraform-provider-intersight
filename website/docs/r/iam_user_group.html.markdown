# Resource: intersight_iam_user_group
User Group provides a way to assign permissions to a group of users based on the IdP attributes received after authentication.
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `idp`:(Array with Maximum of one item) -"A collection of references to the [iam.Idp](mo://iam.Idp) Managed Object.\nWhen this managed object is deleted, the referenced [iam.Idp](mo://iam.Idp) MO unsets its reference to this deleted MO."
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `moid`:(string)(Computed)"The Moid of the referenced REST resource."
  + `object_type`:(string)(Computed)"The Object Type of the referenced REST resource."
  + `selector`:(string)(Computed)"An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field may\nbe set instead of 'moid' by clients. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored. If 'selector'\nis set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight will determine the Moid of the\nresource matching the filter expression and populate it in the MoRef that is part of the object\ninstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request. An error is returned if the filter\nmatches zero or more than one REST resource.\nAn example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'."
* `idpreference`:(Array with Maximum of one item) -"A collection of references to the [iam.IdpReference](mo://iam.IdpReference) Managed Object.\nWhen this managed object is deleted, the referenced [iam.IdpReference](mo://iam.IdpReference) MO unsets its reference to this deleted MO."
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `moid`:(string)(Computed)"The Moid of the referenced REST resource."
  + `object_type`:(string)(Computed)"The Object Type of the referenced REST resource."
  + `selector`:(string)(Computed)"An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field may\nbe set instead of 'moid' by clients. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.

* `moid`:(string)"The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance."
* `name`:(string)"The name of the user group which the dynamic user belongs to."
* `object_type`:(string)(Computed)"The fully-qualified type of this managed object, i.e. the class name.\nThis property is optional. The ObjectType is implied from the URL path.\nIf specified, the value of objectType must match the class name specified in the URL path."
* `permission_resources`:(Array)(Computed)"A slice of all permission resources (organizations) associated with this object. Permission ties resources and its associated roles/privileges.\nThese resources which can be specified in a permission is PermissionResource. Currently only organizations can be specified in permission.\nAll logical and physical resources part of an organization will have organization in PermissionResources field.\nIf DeviceRegistration contains another DeviceRegistration and if parent is in org1 and child is part of org2, then child objects will\nhave PermissionResources as org1 and org2. Parent Objects will have PermissionResources as org1.\nAll profiles/policies created with in an organization will have the organization as PermissionResources."

  + `selector`:(string)(Computed)"An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field may\nbe set instead of 'moid' by clients. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored. If 'selector'\nis set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight will determine the Moid of the\nresource matching the filter expression and populate it in the MoRef that is part of the object\ninstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request. An error is returned if the filter\nmatches zero or more than one REST resource.\nAn example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'."
* `permissions`:(Array)"Permissions assigned to the user group. Permission provides a way to assign roles to a user or user group to perform operations on object hierarchy."

* `qualifier`:(Array with Maximum of one item) -"Qualifier defines which Idp attribute qualifies users to be part of a user group."
