# Resource: intersight_tam_advisory_instance
Instance of an Intersight advisory applicable for an Intersight managed object. An advisory instance is created when a given advisory is found applicable for an Intersight managed object. An advisory instance is retained for some time even after being cleared for historical purposes. A 'cleared' advisory instance is deleted after the retention time is elaspsed.
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `advisory`:(Array with Maximum of one item) -"Reference to the Intersight advisory affecting the managed object."
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `moid`:(string)(Computed)"The Moid of the referenced REST resource."
  + `object_type`:(string)(Computed)"The Object Type of the referenced REST resource."
  + `selector`:(string)(Computed)"An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field may\nbe set instead of 'moid' by clients. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored. If 'selector'\nis set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight will determine the Moid of the\nresource matching the filter expression and populate it in the MoRef that is part of the object\ninstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request. An error is returned if the filter\nmatches zero or more than one REST resource.\nAn example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'."
* `affected_object`:(Array with Maximum of one item) -"Reference to the Intersight managed object afftected by the advisory."
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `moid`:(string)(Computed)"The Moid of the referenced REST resource."
  + `object_type`:(string)(Computed)"The Object Type of the referenced REST resource."
  + `selector`:(string)(Computed)"An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field may\nbe set instead of 'moid' by clients.

* `affected_object_moid`:(string)"Moid of the Intersight MO affected by the alert. Deprecated now and will be removed in subsequent releases."
* `affected_object_type`:(string)"Object type of the Intersight MO affected by the alert. Deprecated now and will be removed in subsequent releases."
* `device_registration`:(Array with Maximum of one item) -"Device registation reference for the managed object affected by a given advisory instance. The managed object itself is represented using 'affectedObject' reference."

* `last_state_change_time`:(string)(Computed)"Timestamp when a state change was observed on this advisory instnace."
* `last_verified_time`:(string)(Computed)"Timestamp when this advisory was last evaluated."
* `moid`:(string)"The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance."
* `object_type`:(string)(Computed)"The fully-qualified type of this managed object, i.e. the class name.\nThis property is optional. The ObjectType is implied from the URL path.\nIf specified, the value of objectType must match the class name specified in the URL path."
* `permission_resources`:(Array)(Computed)"A slice of all permission resources (organizations) associated with this object. Permission ties resources and its associated roles/privileges.\nThese resources which can be specified in a permission is PermissionResource. Currently only organizations can be specified in permission.\nAll logical and physical resources part of an organization will have organization in PermissionResources field.\nIf DeviceRegistration contains another DeviceRegistration and if parent is in org1 and child is part of org2, then child objects will\nhave PermissionResources as org1 and org2. Parent Objects will have PermissionResources as org1.\nAll profiles/policies created with in an organization will have the organization as PermissionResources."

* `state`:(string)"Current state of the advisory instance (Active/Cleared/Unknown etc.)."
* `tags`:(Array)"The array of tags, which allow to add key, value meta-data to managed objects."
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
  + `key`:(string)"The string representation of a tag key."
  + `object_type`:(string)"The concrete type of this complex type.\nThe ObjectType property must be set explicitly by API clients when the type is ambiguous. In all other cases, the \nObjectType is optional. \nThe type is ambiguous when a managed object contains an array of nested documents, and the documents in the array\nare heterogeneous, i.e. the array can contain nested documents of different types."
  + `value`:(string)"The string representation of a tag value."
