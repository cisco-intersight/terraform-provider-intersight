# Resource: intersight_iam_idp
The SAML identity provider such as Cisco, that has been used to log in to Intersight.
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `account`:(Array with Maximum of one item) -(Computed)"A collection of references to the [iam.Account](mo://iam.Account) Managed Object.\nWhen this managed object is deleted, the referenced [iam.Account](mo://iam.Account) MO unsets its reference to this deleted MO."
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `moid`:(string)(Computed)"The Moid of the referenced REST resource."
  + `object_type`:(string)(Computed)"The Object Type of the referenced REST resource."
  + `selector`:(string)(Computed)"An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field may\nbe set instead of 'moid' by clients. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored. If 'selector'\nis set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight will determine the Moid of the\nresource matching the filter expression and populate it in the MoRef that is part of the object\ninstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request. An error is returned if the filter\nmatches zero or more than one REST resource.\nAn example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'."
* `domain_name`:(string)"Email domain name of the user for this IdP. When a user enters an email during login in the Intersight home page, the IdP is picked by matching this domain name with the email domain name for authentication."
* `idp_entity_id`:(string)(Computed)"The Entity ID of the IdP. In SAML, the entity ID uniquely identifies the IdP or Service Provider."
* `ldap_policy`:(Array with Maximum of one item) -(Computed)"When a relationship to an LDAP Policy exists, IdP represents the domain of that LDAP Policy."
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `moid`:(string)(Computed)"The Moid of the referenced REST resource."
  + `object_type`:(string)(Computed)"The Object Type of the referenced REST resource."
  + `selector`:(string)(Computed)"An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field may\nbe set instead of 'moid' by clients. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored. If 'selector'\nis set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight will determine the Moid of the\nresource matching the filter expression and populate it in the MoRef that is part of the object\ninstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request. An error is returned if the filter\nmatches zero or more than one REST resource.\nAn example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'."
* `metadata`:(string)"SAML metadata of the IdP."
* `moid`:(string)"The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance."

* `object_type`:(string)(Computed)"The fully-qualified type of this managed object, i.e. the class name.\nThis property is optional. The ObjectType is implied from the URL path.\nIf specified, the value of objectType must match the class name specified in the URL path."
* `permission_resources`:(Array)(Computed)"A slice of all permission resources (organizations) associated with this object. Permission ties resources and its associated roles/privileges.\nThese resources which can be specified in a permission is PermissionResource. Currently only organizations can be specified in permission.\nAll logical and physical resources part of an organization will have organization in PermissionResources field.\nIf DeviceRegistration contains another DeviceRegistration and if parent is in org1 and child is part of org2, then child objects will\nhave PermissionResources as org1 and org2. Parent Objects will have PermissionResources as org1.\nAll profiles/policies created with in an organization will have the organization as PermissionResources."

* `system`:(Array with Maximum of one item) -(Computed)"A collection of references to the [iam.System](mo://iam.System) Managed Object.\nWhen this managed object is deleted, the referenced [iam.System](mo://iam.System) MO unsets its reference to this deleted MO."
