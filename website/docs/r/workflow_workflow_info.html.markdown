# Resource: intersight_workflow_workflow_info
Contains information for a workflow execution which is a runtime instance of workflow.
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `account`:(Array with Maximum of one item) -The Account to which the workflow is associated.
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `moid`:(string)(Computed)The Moid of the referenced REST resource.
  + `object_type`:(string)(Computed)The Object Type of the referenced REST resource.
  + `selector`:(string)(Computed)An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored. If 'selector'is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight will determine the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populate it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request. An error is returned if the filtermatches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'.
* `action`:(string)The action of the workflow such as start, cancel, retry, pause.
* `cleanup_time`:(string)(Computed)The time when the workflow info will be removed from database.
* `end_time`:(string)(Computed)The time when the workflow reached a final state.
* `failed_workflow_cleanup_duration`:(int)The duration in hours after which the workflow info for failed, terminated or timed out workflow will be removed from database.
* `input`:All the given inputs for the workflow.
* `inst_id`:(string)(Computed)A workflow instance Id which is the unique identified for the workflow execution.
* `internal`:(bool)Denotes if this workflow is internal and should be hidden from user view of running workflows.
* `last_action`:(string)(Computed)The last action that was issued on the workflow is saved in this field.
* `message`:(Array)Collection of Workflow execution messages with severity.
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
  + `message`:(string)An i18n message that can be translated in multiple languages to support internationalization.

In all other cases, the ObjectType is optional. The type is ambiguous when a managed object contains an array of nested documents, and the documents in the arrayare heterogeneous, i.e. the array can contain nested documents of different types.
