# Resource: intersight_hyperflex_node_config_policy
A policy specifying node details such as management and storage data IP ranges. For HyperFlex Edge, storage data IP range is pre-defined.
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `class_id`:(string)(Computed)"The concrete type of this complex type. Its value must be the same as the 'objectType' property.\nThe OpenAPI document references this property as a discriminator value."
* `cluster_profiles`:(Array)"List of cluster profiles using this policy."
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `moid`:(string)(Computed)"The Moid of the referenced REST resource."
  + `object_type`:(string)(Computed)"The Object Type of the referenced REST resource."
  + `selector`:(string)(Computed)"An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field may\nbe set instead of 'moid' by clients.\n1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.\n1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of the\nresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the object\ninstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.\nAn error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.\nAn example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'."
* `data_ip_range`:(Array with Maximum of one item) -"The range of storage data IPs to be assigned to the nodes."
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
  + `class_id`:(string)(Computed)"The concrete type of this complex type. Its value must be the same as the 'objectType' property.\nThe OpenAPI document references this property as a discriminator value."
  + `end_addr`:(string)"The end IPv4 address of the range."
  + `gateway`:(string)"The default gateway for the start and end IPv4 addresses."
  + `netmask`:(string)"The netmask specified in dot decimal notation.\nThe start address, end address, and gateway must all be within the network specified by this netmask."
  + `object_type`:(string)"The concrete type of this complex type.\nThe ObjectType property must be set explicitly by API clients when the type is ambiguous. In all other cases, the \nObjectType is optional. \nThe type is ambiguous when a managed object contains an array of nested documents, and the documents in the array\nare heterogeneous, i.e. the array can contain nested documents of different types."
  + `start_addr`:(string)"The start IPv4 address of the range."
* `description`:(string)"Description of the policy."
* `hxdp_ip_range`:(Array with Maximum of one item) -"The range of storage management IPs to be assigned to the nodes."

  + `end_addr`:(string)"The end IPv4 address of the range."
  + `gateway`:(string)"The default gateway for the start and end IPv4 addresses."
  + `netmask`:(string)"The netmask specified in dot decimal notation.\nThe start address, end address, and gateway must all be within the network specified by this netmask."
  + `object_type`:(string)"The concrete type of this complex type.\nThe ObjectType property must be set explicitly by API clients when the type is ambiguous. In all other cases, the \nObjectType is optional. \nThe type is ambiguous when a managed object contains an array of nested documents, and the documents in the array\nare heterogeneous, i.e. the array can contain nested documents of different types."
  + `start_addr`:(string)"The start IPv4 address of the range."
* `mgmt_ip_range`:(Array with Maximum of one item) -"The range of management IPs to be assigned to the nodes."

* `object_type`:(string)(Computed)"The fully-qualified type of this managed object, i.e. the class name.\nThis property is optional. The ObjectType is implied from the URL path.\nIf specified, the value of objectType must match the class name specified in the URL path."
