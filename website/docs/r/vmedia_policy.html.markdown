# Resource: intersight_vmedia_policy
Policy to configure virtual media settings on endpoint.
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `description`:(string)Description of the policy.
* `enabled`:(bool)State of the Virtual Media service on the endpoint.
* `encryption`:(bool)If enabled, allows encryption of all Virtual Media communications.
* `low_power_usb`:(bool)If enabled, the virtual drives appear on the boot selection menu after mapping the image and rebooting the host.
* `mappings`:(Array)Adds a new Virtual Media mapping for images.
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
  + `authentication_protocol`:(string)Type of Authentication protocol when CIFS is used for communication with the remote server.
  + `device_type`:(string)Type of remote Virtual Media device.
  + `host_name`:(string)IP address or hostname of the remote server.
  + `is_password_set`:(bool)
  + `mount_options`:(string)Mount options for the Virtual Media mapping. The field can be left blank or filled in a comma separated list with the following options.\n For NFS, supported options are ro, rw, nolock, noexec, soft, port=VALUE, timeo=VALUE, retry=VALUE.\n For CIFS, supported options are soft, nounix, noserverino, guest.\n For HTTP/HTTPS, the only supported option is noauto.
  + `mount_protocol`:(string)Protocol to use to communicate with the remote server.
  + `object_type`:(string)The concrete type of this complex type.The ObjectType property must be set explicitly by API clients when the type is ambiguous. In all other cases, the ObjectType is optional. The type is ambiguous when a managed object contains an array of nested documents, and the documents in the arrayare heterogeneous, i.e. the array can contain nested documents of different types.
  + `password`:(string)Password associated with the username.
  + `remote_file`:(string)Name of the remote file. It should be of .img format for HDD Virtual Media mapping and .iso format for CDD Virtual Media mapping.
  + `remote_path`:(string)URL path to the location of the image on the remote server. The preferred format is '/path/'.
  + `username`:(string)Username to log in to the remote server.
  + `volume_name`:(string)Identity of the image for Virtual Media mapping.
* `moid`:(string)The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance.
* `name`:(string)Name of the concrete policy.
* `object_type`:(string)(Computed)The fully-qualified type of this managed object, i.e. the class name.This property is optional. The ObjectType is implied from the URL path.If specified, the value of objectType must match the class name specified in the URL path.
* `organization`:(Array with Maximum of one item) -Relationship to the Organization that owns the Managed Object.
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `moid`:(string)(Computed)The Moid of the referenced REST resource.
  + `object_type`:(string)(Computed)The Object Type of the referenced REST resource.
  + `selector`:(string)(Computed)An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored. If 'selector'is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight will determine the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populate it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request. An error is returned if the filtermatches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'.
* `permission_resources`:(Array)(Computed)A slice of all permission resources (organizations) associated with this object. Permission ties resources and its associated roles/privileges.These resources which can be specified in a permission is PermissionResource. Currently only organizations can be specified in permission.All logical and physical resources part of an organization will have organization in PermissionResources field.If DeviceRegistration contains another DeviceRegistration and if parent is in org1 and child is part of org2, then child objects willhave PermissionResources as org1 and org2. Parent Objects will have PermissionResources as org1.All profiles/policies created with in an organization will have the organization as PermissionResources.
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `moid`:(string)(Computed)The Moid of the referenced REST resource.
  + `object_type`:(string)(Computed)The Object Type of the referenced REST resource.
  + `selector`:(string)(Computed)An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored. If 'selector'is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight will determine the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populate it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request. An error is returned if the filtermatches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'.
* `profiles`:(Array)Relationship to the profile object.
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `moid`:(string)(Computed)The Moid of the referenced REST resource.
  + `object_type`:(string)(Computed)The Object Type of the referenced REST resource.
  + `selector`:(string)(Computed)An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored. If 'selector'is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight will determine the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populate it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request. An error is returned if the filtermatches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'.
* `tags`:(Array)The array of tags, which allow to add key, value meta-data to managed objects.
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
  + `key`:(string)The string representation of a tag key.
  + `object_type`:(string)The concrete type of this complex type.The ObjectType property must be set explicitly by API clients when the type is ambiguous. In all other cases, the ObjectType is optional. The type is ambiguous when a managed object contains an array of nested documents, and the documents in the arrayare heterogeneous, i.e. the array can contain nested documents of different types.
  + `value`:(string)The string representation of a tag value.
