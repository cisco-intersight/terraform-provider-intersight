# Resource: intersight_recovery_backup_profile
Backup profile to initiate on-demand or scheduled backups at end points.
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `action`:(string)User initiated action. Each profile type has its own supported actions. For HyperFlex cluster profile, the supported actions are -- Validate, Deploy, Continue, Retry, Abort, Unassign For server profile, the support actions are -- Deploy, Unassign.
* `backup_config`:(Array with Maximum of one item) -A collection of references to the [recovery.BackupConfigPolicy](mo://recovery.BackupConfigPolicy) Managed Object.When this managed object is deleted, the referenced [recovery.BackupConfigPolicy](mo://recovery.BackupConfigPolicy) MO unsets its reference to this deleted MO.
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `moid`:(string)(Computed)The Moid of the referenced REST resource.
  + `object_type`:(string)(Computed)The Object Type of the referenced REST resource.
  + `selector`:(string)(Computed)An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored. If 'selector'is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight will determine the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populate it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request. An error is returned if the filtermatches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'.
* `config_context`:(Array with Maximum of one item) -The configuration state and results of the last configuration operation.
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
  + `config_state`:(string)(Computed)Indicates a profile's configuration deploying state. Values -- Assigned, Not-assigned, Associated, Pending-changes, Validating, Configuring, Failed.
  + `control_action`:(string)System action to trigger the appropriate workflow. Values -- No_op, ConfigChange, Deploy, Unbind.
  + `error_state`:(string)Indicates a profile's error state. Values -- Validation-error (Static validation error), Pre-config-error (Runtime validation error), Config-error (Runtime configuration error).
  + `object_type`:(string)The concrete type of this complex type.The ObjectType property must be set explicitly by API clients when the type is ambiguous. In all other cases, the ObjectType is optional. The type is ambiguous when a managed object contains an array of nested documents, and the documents in the arrayare heterogeneous, i.e. the array can contain nested documents of different types.
  + `oper_state`:(string)(Computed)Combined state (configState, and operational state of the associated physical resource) to indicate the current state of the profile. Values -- n/a, Power-off, Pending-changes, Configuring, Ok, Failed.
* `config_result`:(Array with Maximum of one item) -(Computed)The profile configuration (deploy, validation) results with the overall state and detailed result messages.

If 'selector'is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight will determine the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populate it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request. An error is returned if the filtermatches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'.
* `description`:(string)Description of the profile.
* `device_id`:(Array with Maximum of one item) -Relationship to all the end devices associated to this backup profile.

* `enabled`:(bool)Enables/Disables the schedule on the endpoint.
* `moid`:(string)The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance.
* `name`:(string)Name of the concrete profile.
* `object_type`:(string)(Computed)The fully-qualified type of this managed object, i.e. the class name.This property is optional. The ObjectType is implied from the URL path.If specified, the value of objectType must match the class name specified in the URL path.
* `organization`:(Array with Maximum of one item) -Relationship to the Organization that owns the Managed Object.
