API keys are used to programatically perform API calls. API keys can be created by passing purpose field, which is a description for the application using API keys. Maximum of 3 API keys per user is allowed. API key will have RSA key pair generated and as part of create request key MOID, private and public key in PEM format are returned. In Intersight only the public key is stored. Client side private key is stored and is used for signature calculation. API key requests are authenticated using RSA SHA 256 signature validations. If the incoming request for authorization has X-Starship-Token, then session based authorization is done, else API key based authorization is performed. Once User, API key and Account are found and signature verification succeeds, then the privilege validations are performed.
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `hash_algorithm`:(string)The cryptographic hash algorithm to calculate the message digest.
* `key_spec`:(Array with Maximum of one item) -The key generation specification provides the algorithm and the parameters required for this algorithm to generate a private key, public key pair. Supported key generation schemes include RSA, ECDSA and Edwards-Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (EdDSA).
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
  + `name`:(string)(Computed)Name of the key generation algorithm.
  + `object_type`:(string)The concrete type of this complex type.The ObjectType property must be set explicitly by API clients when the type is ambiguous. In all other cases, the ObjectType is optional. The type is ambiguous when a managed object contains an array of nested documents, and the documents in the arrayare heterogeneous, i.e. the array can contain nested documents of different types.
* `moid`:(string)The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance.
* `object_type`:(string)(Computed)The fully-qualified type of this managed object, i.e. the class name.This property is optional. The ObjectType is implied from the URL path.If specified, the value of objectType must match the class name specified in the URL path.
* `permission`:(Array with Maximum of one item) -(Computed)Permissions associated with the API key. Permission provides a way to assign roles to a user or user group to perform operations on object hierarchy.
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `moid`:(string)(Computed)The Moid of the referenced REST resource.
  + `object_type`:(string)(Computed)The Object Type of the referenced REST resource.
  + `selector`:(string)(Computed)An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored. If 'selector'is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight will determine the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populate it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request. An error is returned if the filtermatches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'.
* `permission_resources`:(Array)(Computed)A slice of all permission resources (organizations) associated with this object. Permission ties resources and its associated roles/privileges.These resources which can be specified in a permission is PermissionResource. Currently only organizations can be specified in permission.All logical and physical resources part of an organization will have organization in PermissionResources field.If DeviceRegistration contains another DeviceRegistration and if parent is in org1 and child is part of org2, then child objects willhave PermissionResources as org1 and org2. Parent Objects will have PermissionResources as org1.All profiles/policies created with in an organization will have the organization as PermissionResources.
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `moid`:(string)(Computed)The Moid of the referenced REST resource.
  + `object_type`:(string)(Computed)The Object Type of the referenced REST resource.
  + `selector`:(string)(Computed)An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored. If 'selector'is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight will determine the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populate it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request. An error is returned if the filtermatches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'.
* `private_key`:(string)Holds the private key for the API key.
* `purpose`:(string)The purpose of the API Key.
* `signing_algorithm`:(string)The signing algorithm used by the client to authenticate API requests to Intersight.The following key generation schemes are supported:1. RSASSA-PSS, as defined in RFC 8017 [RFC8017], Section 8.1,2. ECDSA P-256, as defined in ANSI X9.62-2005 ECDSA and FIPS 186-4,3. Ed25519ph, Ed25519ctx, and Ed25519, as defined in RFC 8032 [RFC8032], Section 5.1.The signing algorithm must be compatible with the key generation specification.
* `tags`:(Array)The array of tags, which allow to add key, value meta-data to managed objects.
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
  + `key`:(string)The string representation of a tag key.
  + `object_type`:(string)The concrete type of this complex type.The ObjectType property must be set explicitly by API clients when the type is ambiguous. In all other cases, the ObjectType is optional. The type is ambiguous when a managed object contains an array of nested documents, and the documents in the arrayare heterogeneous, i.e. the array can contain nested documents of different types.
  + `value`:(string)The string representation of a tag value.
* `user`:(Array with Maximum of one item) -(Computed)A collection of references to the [iam.User](mo://iam.User) Managed Object.When this managed object is deleted, the referenced [iam.User](mo://iam.User) MO unsets its reference to this deleted MO.
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `moid`:(string)(Computed)The Moid of the referenced REST resource.
  + `object_type`:(string)(Computed)The Object Type of the referenced REST resource.
  + `selector`:(string)(Computed)An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored. If 'selector'is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight will determine the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populate it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request. An error is returned if the filtermatches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'.
