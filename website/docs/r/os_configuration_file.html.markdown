# Resource: intersight_os_configuration_file
A ConfigurationFile is an OS specific answer file that helps with the unattended
installation.
The file can also be a template file with placeholders instead of actual answers.
Intersight supports the golang template syntax specified in https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/.
The template supports placeholders for all the properties of os.Answers MO type
as well as any additional user-defined properties. The values for these placeholders
shall be given during OS installation in the form of os.Answers type and 'additionalProperties' in
os.OsInstall object.
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `catalog`:(Array with Maximum of one item) -A collection of references to the [os.Catalog](mo://os.Catalog) Managed Object.When this managed object is deleted, the referenced [os.Catalog](mo://os.Catalog) MO unsets its reference to this deleted MO.
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `moid`:(string)(Computed)The Moid of the referenced REST resource.
  + `object_type`:(string)(Computed)The Object Type of the referenced REST resource.
  + `selector`:(string)(Computed)An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored. If 'selector'is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight will determine the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populate it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request. An error is returned if the filtermatches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'.
* `distributions`:(Array)This captures the operating system for which this configuration file isdefined.

* `file_content`:(string)The content of the entire configuration file is stored as value. The contentcan either be a static file content or a template content.The template is expected to conform to the golang template syntax. The valuesfrom os.Answers properties will be used to populate this template.
* `moid`:(string)The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance.
* `name`:(string)The name of the OS ConfigurationFile that uniquely identifies the configuration file.
* `object_type`:(string)(Computed)The fully-qualified type of this managed object, i.e. the class name.This property is optional. The ObjectType is implied from the URL path.If specified, the value of objectType must match the class name specified in the URL path.
* `permission_resources`:(Array)(Computed)A slice of all permission resources (organizations) associated with this object. Permission ties resources and its associated roles/privileges.These resources which can be specified in a permission is PermissionResource. Currently only organizations can be specified in permission.All logical and physical resources part of an organization will have organization in PermissionResources field.If DeviceRegistration contains another DeviceRegistration and if parent is in org1 and child is part of org2, then child objects willhave PermissionResources as org1 and org2. Parent Objects will have PermissionResources as org1.All profiles/policies created with in an organization will have the organization as PermissionResources.
