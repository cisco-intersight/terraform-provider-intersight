  AppRegistration encapsulates the meta-data values of a registered OAuth2 client application, as described in
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7591#section-2.
Registered client applications have a set of metadata values associated with their client identifier
at the Intersight authorization server, including the list of valid redirection URIs or a display name.
The meta-data is used to specify how a client application can retrieve a OAuth2 Access Token and subsequently
invoke Intersight API on behalf of this AppRegistration.
To register an OAuth2 application, the following information must be provided.
1) Application name
2) An icon for the application
3) URL to the application's home page
4) A short description of the application
5) A list of redirect URLs
When an AppRegistration is created, a unique OAuth2 clientId is generated and returned in the HTTP response.

## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `account`:(Array with Maximum of one item) -(Computed) A reference to a iamAccount resource.When the $expand query parameter is specified, the referenced resource is returned inline. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `class_id`:(string)(Computed) The concrete type of this complex type. Its value must be the same as the 'objectType' property.The OpenAPI document references this property as a discriminator value. 
  + `moid`:(string)(Computed) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The concrete type of this complex type.The ObjectType property must be set explicitly by API clients when the type is ambiguous. In all other cases, the ObjectType is optional. The type is ambiguous when a managed object contains an array of nested documents, and the documents in the arrayare heterogeneous, i.e. the array can contain nested documents of different types. 
  + `selector`:(string)(Computed) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'. 
* `class_id`:(string)(Computed) The concrete type of this complex type. Its value must be the same as the 'objectType' property.The OpenAPI document references this property as a discriminator value. 
* `client_id`:(string)(Computed) A unique identifier for the OAuth2 client application.The client ID is auto-generated when the AppRegistration object is created. 
* `client_name`:(string) App Registration name specified by user. 
* `client_secret`:(string) The OAuth2 client secret.The value of this property is generated when grantType includes 'client-credentials'.Otherwise, no client-secret is generated. 
* `client_type`:(string) The type of the OAuth2 client (public or confidential), as specified in https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-2.1. 
* `description`:(string) Description of the application. 
* `grant_types`:
                (Array of schema.TypeString) -
* `moid`:(string) The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. 
* `oauth_tokens`:(Array)(Computed) An array of relationships to iamOAuthToken resources.

* `object_type`:(string)(Computed) The fully-qualified type of this managed object, i.e. the class name.This property is optional. The ObjectType is implied from the URL path.If specified, the value of objectType must match the class name specified in the URL path. 
* `permission`:(Array with Maximum of one item) -(Computed) A reference to a iamPermission resource.When the $expand query parameter is specified, the referenced resource is returned inline.
