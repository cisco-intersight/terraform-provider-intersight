# Resource: intersight_tam_security_advisory
Intersight representation of a Cisco PSIRT (https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/publicationListing.x) advisory definition. It includes the description of the security advisory and a corresponding reference to the published advisory. It also includes the Intersight data sources needed to evaluate the applicability of this advisory for relevant Intersight managed objects. A PSIRT definition is evaluated against all managed object referenced using the included data sources. Only Cisco TAC and Intersight devops engineers have the ability to create PSIRT definitions in Intersight.
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `api_data_sources`:(Array)An array of data sources that are used to provide data for queries used to identify an Intersight alert applicability.
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
  + `mo_type`:(string)Type of Intersight managed object used as data source.
  + `name`:(string)Name is used to unique identify and refer a given data source in an alert definition.
  + `object_type`:(string)The concrete type of this complex type.The ObjectType property must be set explicitly by API clients when the type is ambiguous. In all other cases, the ObjectType is optional. The type is ambiguous when a managed object contains an array of nested documents, and the documents in the arrayare heterogeneous, i.e. the array can contain nested documents of different types.
  + `queries`:(Array)Optional set of Queries to filter the output for Api datasource. the queries are executed in the order specified.
This complex property has following sub-properties:
    + `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
    + `name`:(string)Name is used to unique identify and result of the given query which can be used by subsequent queries as input data source.
    + `object_type`:(string)The concrete type of this complex type.The ObjectType property must be set explicitly by API clients when the type is ambiguous. In all other cases, the ObjectType is optional. The type is ambiguous when a managed object contains an array of nested documents, and the documents in the arrayare heterogeneous, i.e. the array can contain nested documents of different types.
    + `priority`:(int)An integer value depicting the priority of the query among the queries that are part of the same QueryEntry collection.
    + `query`:(string)A SparkSQL query to be used on a given data source.
  + `type`:(string)Type of data source (for e.g. TextFsmTempalate based, Intersight API based etc.).
* `actions`:(Array)An array of actions that are to be taken when a given managed object matches the criteria specified for being affected by an alert definition.
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
  + `affected_object_type`:(string)Type of the managed object that should be marked with an instance of the Alert (when operation type is create) or that should have an alert instance removed (when operation type is remove).
  + `alert_type`:(string)Alert type is used to denote the category of an Intersight alert (FieldNotice, equipment Fault etc.).
  + `identifiers`:(Array)Identifiers represents the filter criteria (property names and values) used to identify an Intersight managed object of type specified in affectedObjectType property. An instance of an alert is then create on (or removed from) the identified managed object.
This complex property has following sub-properties:
    + `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
    + `name`:(string)Name of the filter paramter.
    + `object_type`:(string)The concrete type of this complex type.The ObjectType property must be set explicitly by API clients when the type is ambiguous. In all other cases, the ObjectType is optional. The type is ambiguous when a managed object contains an array of nested documents, and the documents in the arrayare heterogeneous, i.e. the array can contain nested documents of different types.
    + `value`:(string)Value of the filter paramter.
  + `name`:(string)Uniquely identifies a given action among the set of actions corresponding to an advisory. Primarily used to store and compare results of subsequent iterations corresponding to the action queries.
  + `object_type`:(string)The concrete type of this complex type.The ObjectType property must be set explicitly by API clients when the type is ambiguous. In all other cases, the ObjectType is optional. The type is ambiguous when a managed object contains an array of nested documents, and the documents in the arrayare heterogeneous, i.e. the array can contain nested documents of different types.
  + `operation_type`:(string)Operation type for the alert action. An action is used to carry out the process of \"reacting\" to an alert condition. For e.g.in case of a fieldNotice alert, the intention may be to create a new alert (if the condition matches and there is no existing alert) or to remove an existing alert when the alert condition has been remedied.
  + `queries`:(Array)Set of SparkSQL queries used determine if a given alert is applicable or not. Refer to https://spark.apache.org/sql/ for more details.
This complex property has following sub-properties:
    + `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
    + `name`:(string)Name is used to unique identify and result of the given query which can be used by subsequent queries as input data source.
    + `object_type`:(string)The concrete type of this complex type.The ObjectType property must be set explicitly by API clients when the type is ambiguous. In all other cases, the ObjectType is optional. The type is ambiguous when a managed object contains an array of nested documents, and the documents in the arrayare heterogeneous, i.e. the array can contain nested documents of different types.
    + `priority`:(int)An integer value depicting the priority of the query among the queries that are part of the same QueryEntry collection.
