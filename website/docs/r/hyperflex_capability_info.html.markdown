  A capabilityInfo is like a feature set and/or feature limit for different components of a HyperFlex Cluster. A set of constraints defines the rules, and the corresponding value either determines if the feature would work on a HyperFlex cluster with specific component set, or corresponds to a limit for a set of HyperFlex components. For example, "minUcsVersion" for HyperFlex version "4.0.1a" corresponds to "3.2.3" or "minHxdpVersion" for HyperFlex Upgrade operation is "4.0.1a" etc. This data can be captured as a capability and at run-time, decision can be made to proceed with the intended operation or not, or proceed with the intended operation with a value catered to specific feature sets.

# Resource: intersight_hyperflex_capability_info
A capabilityInfo is like a feature set and/or feature limit for different components of a HyperFlex Cluster. A set of constraints defines the rules, and the corresponding value either determines if the feature would work on a HyperFlex cluster with specific component set, or corresponds to a limit for a set of HyperFlex components. For example, "minUcsVersion" for HyperFlex version "4.0.1a" corresponds to "3.2.3" or "minHxdpVersion" for HyperFlex Upgrade operation is "4.0.1a" etc. This data can be captured as a capability and at run-time, decision can be made to proceed with the intended operation or not, or proceed with the intended operation with a value catered to specific feature sets.

## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `app_catalog`:(Array with Maximum of one item) -A collection of references to the [hyperflex.AppCatalog](mo://hyperflex.AppCatalog) Managed Object.When this managed object is deleted, the referenced [hyperflex.AppCatalog](mo://hyperflex.AppCatalog) MO unsets its reference to this deleted MO.
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `moid`:(string)(Computed)The Moid of the referenced REST resource.
  + `object_type`:(string)(Computed)The Object Type of the referenced REST resource.
  + `selector`:(string)(Computed)An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored. If 'selector'is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight will determine the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populate it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request. An error is returned if the filtermatches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'.
* `capability_constraints`:(Array)Collection of constraints, which when applied together in tandem with an \"AND\" assertion, will correspond to the specified Value. Hence the Value will make sense only iff all the constraints match.
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
  + `constraint_name`:(string)Name or key of the applicable compatibility constraint.
  + `constraint_value`:(string)Value of the applicable compatibility constraint. Could either be a string value or a regex.
  + `object_type`:(string)The concrete type of this complex type.The ObjectType property must be set explicitly by API clients when the type is ambiguous. In all other cases, the ObjectType is optional. The type is ambiguous when a managed object contains an array of nested documents, and the documents in the arrayare heterogeneous, i.e. the array can contain nested documents of different types.
* `moid`:(string)The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance.
* `name`:(string)Name of the capability or feature set consisting of a collection of constraint rules and value.
* `object_type`:(string)(Computed)The fully-qualified type of this managed object, i.e. the class name.This property is optional. The ObjectType is implied from the URL path.If specified, the value of objectType must match the class name specified in the URL path.
* `permission_resources`:(Array)(Computed)A slice of all permission resources (organizations) associated with this object. Permission ties resources and its associated roles/privileges.These resources which can be specified in a permission is PermissionResource. Currently only organizations can be specified in permission.All logical and physical resources part of an organization will have organization in PermissionResources field.If DeviceRegistration contains another DeviceRegistration and if parent is in org1 and child is part of org2, then child objects willhave PermissionResources as org1 and org2. Parent Objects will have PermissionResources as org1.All profiles/policies created with in an organization will have the organization as PermissionResources.
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `moid`:(string)(Computed)The Moid of the referenced REST resource.
  + `object_type`:(string)(Computed)The Object Type of the referenced REST resource.
  + `selector`:(string)(Computed)An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored. If 'selector'is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight will determine the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populate it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request. An error is returned if the filtermatches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'.
* `tags`:(Array)The array of tags, which allow to add key, value meta-data to managed objects.
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
  + `key`:(string)The string representation of a tag key.
  + `object_type`:(string)The concrete type of this complex type.The ObjectType property must be set explicitly by API clients when the type is ambiguous. In all other cases, the ObjectType is optional. The type is ambiguous when a managed object contains an array of nested documents, and the documents in the arrayare heterogeneous, i.e. the array can contain nested documents of different types.
  + `value`:(string)The string representation of a tag value.
* `value`:(string)(Computed)Capability Value which is valid only iff all specified constraints match.
