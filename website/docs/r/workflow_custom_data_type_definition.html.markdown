# Resource: intersight_workflow_custom_data_type_definition
Captures a customized data type definition that can be used for task or workflow input/output.  This can be reused across multiple tasks and workflow definitions.
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `catalog`:(Array with Maximum of one item) -The catalog under which the definition is present.
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `moid`:(string)(Computed)The Moid of the referenced REST resource.
  + `object_type`:(string)(Computed)The Object Type of the referenced REST resource.
  + `selector`:(string)(Computed)An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored. If 'selector'is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight will determine the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populate it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request. An error is returned if the filtermatches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'.
* `composite_type`:(bool)When true this data type definition is a collection of type definitions to represent composite data like JSON.
* `description`:(string)A human-friendly description of this custom data type indicating it's domain and usage.
* `label`:(string)A user friendly short name to identify the custom data type definition.
* `moid`:(string)The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance.
* `name`:(string)The name of custom data type definition. The valid name can contain lower case and upper case alphabetic characters, degits and special characters '-' and '_'.
* `object_type`:(string)(Computed)The fully-qualified type of this managed object, i.e. the class name.This property is optional. The ObjectType is implied from the URL path.If specified, the value of objectType must match the class name specified in the URL path.
* `permission_resources`:(Array)(Computed)A slice of all permission resources (organizations) associated with this object. Permission ties resources and its associated roles/privileges.These resources which can be specified in a permission is PermissionResource. Currently only organizations can be specified in permission.All logical and physical resources part of an organization will have organization in PermissionResources field.If DeviceRegistration contains another DeviceRegistration and if parent is in org1 and child is part of org2, then child objects willhave PermissionResources as org1 and org2. Parent Objects will have PermissionResources as org1.All profiles/policies created with in an organization will have the organization as PermissionResources.

  + `moid`:(string)(Computed)The Moid of the referenced REST resource.
  + `object_type`:(string)(Computed)The Object Type of the referenced REST resource.
  + `selector`:(string)(Computed)An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.

An error is returned if the filtermatches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'.
* `tags`:(Array)The array of tags, which allow to add key, value meta-data to managed objects.
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
  + `key`:(string)The string representation of a tag key.
  + `object_type`:(string)The concrete type of this complex type.The ObjectType property must be set explicitly by API clients when the type is ambiguous. In all other cases, the ObjectType is optional. The type is ambiguous when a managed object contains an array of nested documents, and the documents in the arrayare heterogeneous, i.e. the array can contain nested documents of different types.
  + `value`:(string)The string representation of a tag value.
* `type_definition`:(Array)The properties of this custom data type definition.
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
  + `default`:(Array with Maximum of one item) -Default value for the data type. If default value was provided and the input was required the default value will be used as the input.

The type is ambiguous when a managed object contains an array of nested documents, and the documents in the arrayare heterogeneous, i.e. the array can contain nested documents of different types.
    + `override`:(bool)Override the default value provided for the data type. When true, allow the user to enter value for the data type.
    + `value`:Default value for the data type. If default value was provided and the input was required the default value will be used as the input.
  + `description`:(string)Provide a detailed description of the data type.
  + `label`:(string)Descriptive label for the data type. Name can only contain letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), hyphen (-), space ( ) or an underscore (_). The first and last character in label must be an alphanumeric character.
  + `name`:(string)Descriptive name for the data type. Name can only contain letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), hyphen (-) or an underscore (_). The first and last character in name must be an alphanumeric character.
  + `object_type`:(string)The concrete type of this complex type.The ObjectType property must be set explicitly by API clients when the type is ambiguous. In all other cases, the ObjectType is optional. The type is ambiguous when a managed object contains an array of nested documents, and the documents in the arrayare heterogeneous, i.e. the array can contain nested documents of different types.
  + `required`:(bool)Specifies whether this parameter is required. The field is applicable for task and workflow.
