# Resource: intersight_asset._target
Target represents an entity which can be managed by Intersight. This includes physical entities like UCS and HyperFlex servers and software entities like VMware vCenter and Microsoft Azure cloud accounts.
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `account`:(Array with Maximum of one item) - A reference to a iamAccount resource.When the $expand query parameter is specified, the referenced resource is returned inline. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
  + `class_id`:(string)(Computed) The concrete type of this complex type. Its value must be the same as the 'objectType' property.The OpenAPI document references this property as a discriminator value. 
  + `moid`:(string)(Computed) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The concrete type of this complex type.The ObjectType property must be set explicitly by API clients when the type is ambiguous. In all other cases, the ObjectType is optional. The type is ambiguous when a managed object contains an array of nested documents, and the documents in the arrayare heterogeneous, i.e. the array can contain nested documents of different types. 
  + `selector`:(string)(Computed) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'. 
* `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
* `assist`:(Array with Maximum of one item) - A reference to a assetDeviceRegistration resource.When the $expand query parameter is specified, the referenced resource is returned inline.

The type is ambiguous when a managed object contains an array of nested documents, and the documents in the arrayare heterogeneous, i.e. the array can contain nested documents of different types. 
* `moid`:(string) The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. 
* `object_type`:(string)(Computed) The fully-qualified type of this managed object, i.e. the class name.This property is optional. The ObjectType is implied from the URL path.If specified, the value of objectType must match the class name specified in the URL path. 
* `services`:(Array)
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
  + `class_id`:(string)(Computed) The concrete type of this complex type. Its value must be the same as the 'objectType' property.The OpenAPI document references this property as a discriminator value. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The concrete type of this complex type.The ObjectType property must be set explicitly by API clients when the type is ambiguous. In all other cases, the ObjectType is optional. The type is ambiguous when a managed object contains an array of nested documents, and the documents in the arrayare heterogeneous, i.e. the array can contain nested documents of different types. 
  + `options`:(Array with Maximum of one item) - Captures configuration that is specific to a target type for a specific service.

  + `status`:(string) Status indicates if the respective Service can establish a connection and authenticate with the managed target. Status does not include information about the functional health of the target. 
  + `status_error_reason`:(string) When 'Status' is not Connected, statusErrorReason provides further details about why the device is not connected with Intersight. 
* `status`:(string)(Computed) Status indicates if Intersight can establish a connection and authenticate with the managed target. Status does not include information about the functional health of the target. 
* `status_error_reason`:(string)(Computed) StatusErrorReason provides additional context for the Status. 
* `tags`:(Array)
